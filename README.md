## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React - JS library
- Bootstrap - For styles

For the time being, I made a file to store the data, so that the same solution can be extened when other projects needs to be added or the data needs to be fetched from some API.

### What I learned

- Planning layouts
- Component interactons
- Lifting state up
- Continuous deployment.

More importantly, making MVP within a short duration.
